# Teta OSS Editor

Teta OSS is a local, AI-powered app builder, available in an open-source version.  
This version includes only the editor, designed to work with a single project. The project path must be declared using a `.env` file.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure the following tools are installed on your system:  
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)  
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)

## How to run

Teta OSS consists of two main components:  
1. **`pkgs/server`**: A lightweight server app responsible for managing project-related operations. See requirements.
2. **`apps/desktop`**: A Flutter-based desktop application that includes Teta's programming editor. See requirements.

To start using Teta OSS, you need to run both components.
